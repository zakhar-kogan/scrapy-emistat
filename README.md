# Scrapy Numbeo CCLI Parser
A Scrapy (Zyte) module to parse Numbeo's City Cost of Life Index and a couple of other websites for the Relocation QoL model service we're planning to launch.
## Usage

The easiest way is importing into Zyte.com's Scrapy Cloud. 
You can also run it locally with 
```
scrapy crawl...
```

or 
```
cd scrapy-numbeo-ccli
scrapy run spider.py [-o export.json]
```
